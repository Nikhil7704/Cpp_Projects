# C++ Projects by Nikhil Tiwari

Welcome to my **C++ Projects** repository! This repository is a collection of various C++ projects that I have created as I continue to enhance my programming skills. Each project showcases my understanding of different programming concepts, and I will continue to add more projects as I progress.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you will find in this repository:

- **Hotel Management System**  
  A project that simulates a hotel booking system with features like room selection, cost calculation, and availability management.

- **Number Guessing Game**  
  A simple console-based game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number.

### Upcoming Projects

As I continue to learn and develop, more projects will be added, including:
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implementing sorting, searching, and other advanced algorithms.
- **Data Structures**: Exploring various data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

Each project demonstrates my progress and helps me understand C++ concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), memory management, and more.
